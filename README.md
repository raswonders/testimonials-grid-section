### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://sensational-heliotrope-4dcaff.netlify.app/](https://sensational-heliotrope-4dcaff.netlify.app/)

## My process
I created html skeleton with all the data. Then I applied mobile styles. After i extended styles in order to make it responsive. As last thing I've refactored tw classes a little bit and made features and banner separate components.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library 

### What I learned

I rehashed some forgotten grid theory, also realized there is so many layouts I've never tried to create with grid. I've also had to add distinct tw classes dynamically to elements in a array, which was fun problem to deal with. 

### Continued development

While learning about grid, I was mesmerized by sizing flexibility of grid items, i want to test its auto-sizing capabilities futher.
